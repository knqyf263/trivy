Context: This commit implements a unique Report ID feature for Trivy scan reports.

Original Request:
The requirement was to add a unique ID to scan reports to link local reports with Trivy Cloud SaaS reports. Three implementation approaches were considered:
1. UUID generation (chosen approach)
2. Hash of Artifact ID + Timestamp
3. Hybrid approach

Implementation Decision:
- Used UUID v4 for unique report identification
- Added ReportID field to the Report struct in pkg/types/report.go
- UUID is automatically generated in pkg/scan/service.go during ScanArtifact
- Leveraged existing pkg/uuid package with mock support for testing

Rationale for UUID Approach:
- Guarantees uniqueness (near-zero collision probability)
- Simple implementation using existing uuid library
- Easy management in Trivy Cloud
- Concise format (36 characters)

Trade-offs:
- No reproducibility (different ID for same scan)
- No semantic information in the ID for debugging

Future Considerations:
- Add --report-id flag to allow external ID specification
- Enable reproducible IDs for CI/CD environments where needed

This implementation provides a solid foundation for report tracking between local scans and Trivy Cloud.
